ThreeGee Test

This was a simple application I wrote to narrow down a bug in the 5.0 Version of the Danger OS relating to Data connectivity and a "Fake G" situation where the device would appear to have a data connection, but in fact didn't.

It was discovered that if packets were sent every approximately 13 minutes, the connection would stay alive.

I've heard that this app was used internally at Danger, but can't confirm.
